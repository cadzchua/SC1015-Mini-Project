### General Tips:

- **Presentation Style**:
    - Any group member(s) can deliver the presentation. You may choose one speaker or divide the presentation among the team.
  
- **Slides/Notebooks**:
    - Use slides (PPT, PDF, Google Slides) and Jupyter Notebooks to present workflow and findings.
    - Avoid showing raw code unless absolutely necessary. Focus on results and observations.
  
- **Voice**:
    - Present in your own voice (no robo-voiceover).
    - Showing faces is optional, but you can include them if desired.

- **Content Scope**:
    - Concentrate on the main aspects of your project within the 10-minute limit.
    - Additional details (e.g., team contributions, references) should be included in the GitHub README file.
