# **Mini-Project Submission Guidelines and FAQs**

### Submission
- **Deadline**: November 18th, Monday, 11:59 pm.
- **Open**: November 4th.
- **Submission Chances**: Multiple, last submission before the deadline will be graded.

---

### Items to Submit:
1. **Video Presentation** (MP4 format only)
2. **GitHub Repository URL** with the full codebase

For details on how to structure the video, see the [Video Presentation Guidelines](./video_req.md).

---

### Video Presentation:
- Submit a single MP4 file, named with your Lab Group and team members' last names for unique identification.
- Start the video by clearly displaying your Lab Group and the names of each team member.
- Follow the structure and flow provided in the ["Video Presentation Guidelines"](./video_req.md).
- No need to mention individual contributions or references in the video (these can go in the GitHub repository).

---

### GitHub Repository:
- Ensure all codes/notebooks and dataset(s) are included for the TA to review.
- Make sure the **README** file is well-written (like a short report) to describe your work.
    - It should broadly explain the project but doesn't need all minor details.
    - Keep it simple and compact but sufficiently detailed (3-5 minute read).
    - Include:
        - An overview of the project.
        - Individual contributions by team members.
        - Online/offline references consulted or utilized.
- Submit the GitHub URL in the text field provided when submitting the video.

## FAQs

### Grading Scheme:
- **10%**: Problem definition based on dataset.
- **10%**: Data preparation and cleaning.
- **20%**: Exploratory data analysis/visualization.
- **20%**: Use of machine learning techniques.
- **20%**: Presentation of data-driven insights and recommendations.
- **10%**: Quality of team presentation and overall impression.
- **10%**: Learning something new, beyond the course content.

### Dataset Problem:
- Choose a problem that cannot be solved by simply copy-pasting course code.
- Consult your Lab TA to ensure your problem is interesting but achievable.

### Data Preparation & Cleaning:
- Clean and format the dataset to suit your problem.
- May involve resizing data, removing outliers, or merging data from multiple sources.

### Visualization:
- Standard statistical visualizations should be sufficient for EDA.
- Focus on gathering relevant insights to support your project.
- Avoid spending excessive time on creating fancy dashboards or interfaces.

### Machine Learning:
- Use machine learning techniques when appropriate.
- Stick to tools covered in the course unless you're confident in using others.
- Be cautious not to overcomplicate with tools that take too much time to learn.

### Learning Something New:
- Apply a new ML model, visualization tool, or technique for data preparation.
- Focus on learning one or two new things, not overloading with too much new material.

### Final Presentation Format:
- Submit a 10-minute video using PPT/PDF/Google Slides with code snippets and visualizations.
- Demonstrations of tools or applications based on your project are optional.
- Focus on explaining steps from your motivation to your data-driven solution.

### Peer Assessment:
- Individual contributions will be evaluated through peer assessment.
- Your group effort will be scaled based on peer-assessment scores.

### Submission Requirements:
- Submit the final presentation video and a GitHub link with your codebase.
- All codes (Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, visualizations) should be on GitHub.
