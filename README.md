# SC1015 Mini-Project: Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This mini-project focuses on analysing the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic using data from Kaggle. The project aims to uncover insights regarding factors that influenced survival during the tragic sinking of the ship.

## Team Members
- **Cadden Chua**
- **Chooi Li Hang**
- **Tristan Ng**

## Objectives
- To explore the dataset and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting survival.
- To visualise the data through various plots, providing insights into the relationships between different variables.
- To formulate and answer specific research questions related to passenger survival.

## Dataset
The project utilises the Titanic dataset, which includes various features of the passengers such as:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Age (`Age`)
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Fare (`Fare`)
- Family Size (`SibSp`, `Parch`)
- Embarkation Point (`Embarked`)

## Key Questions
1. What is the relationship between passenger class and survival?
2. How does age impact survival rates?
3. Is there a correlation between gender and survival?
4. What is the relationship between family size (`SibSp`, `Parch`) and survival?
5. Does the embarkation point (`Embarked`) affect survival chances?

## Visualisations
The project includes several visualisations, including:
- Bar plots to illustrate survival rates by passenger class, age, gender, family size, and embarkation point.
- Box plots to show the distribution of age and fare among survivors and non-survivors.

## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy xgboost
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook to view the analysis and visualisations.
